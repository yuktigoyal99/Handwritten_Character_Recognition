# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
In this machine learning project, it will recognize handwritten digits. 

# Required frameworks are :

Install the necessary libraries for this project using this command:

pip install numpy, tensorflow, keras, pillow,

# Dataset Used:

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.
